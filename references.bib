abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most promising non-invasive techniques for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In this paper, we explore the application of different machine learning techniques to the classification of fMRI data for this purpose. The functional images were firstly preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox to output individual maps of statistically activated voxels. A fast filter was applied afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and non-demented groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14{\%} average accuracy. Results repeatedly pointed out Brodmann regions with distinct activation patterns between demented and non demented profiles, indicating that the machine learning analysis described is a powerful method to detect differences in several brain regions between both groups.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

@article{Morra2010,
abstract = {We compared four automated methods for hippocampal segmentation using different machine learning algorithms (1) hierarchical AdaBoost, (2) Support Vector Machines (SVM) with manual feature selection, (3) hierarchical SVM with automated feature selection (Ada-SVM), and (4) a publicly available brain segmentation package (FreeSurfer). We trained our approaches using T1- weighted brain MRI's from 30 subjects (10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD)), and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected p -values, for the 3D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested. Cumulative p - value plots, in conjunction with the False Discovery Rate method, were used to examine the power of each method to detect correlations with diagnosis and cognitive scores. We also evaluated how segmentation accuracy depended on the size of the training set, providing practical information for future users of this technique. Index},

abstract = {Interpreting brain image experiments requires analysis of complex, multivariate data. In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of 'is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely 'where is the information' (pattern localization) and 'how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a relative newcomer in the field of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). fMRI has several potential advantages, particularly for clinical trials, as it is a noninvasive imaging technique that does not require the injection of contrast agent or radiation exposure and thus can be repeated many times during a longitudinal study. fMRI has relatively high spatial and reasonable temporal resolution, and can be acquired in the same session as structural magnetic resonance imaging. Perhaps most importantly, fMRI may provide useful information about the functional integrity of brain networks supporting memory and other cognitive domains, including the neural correlates of specific behavioral events, such as successful versus failed memory formation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},
