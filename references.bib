We trained our approaches using T1- weighted brain MRI's from 30 subjects (10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD)), and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected p -values, for the 3D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested. Cumulative p - value plots, in conjunction with the False Discovery Rate method, were used to examine the power of each method to detect correlations with diagnosis and cognitive scores. We also evaluated how segmentation accuracy depended on the size of the training set, providing practical information for future users of this technique. Index},

abstract = {Multivariate pattern analysis and statistical machine learning techniques are attracting increasing interest from the neuroimaging community. Researchers and clinicians are also increasingly interested in the study of functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest and how these relations might change in conditions like Alzheimer's disease or clinical depression. In this study we investigate the efficacy of a specific multivariate statistical machine learning technique to perform patient stratification from functional-connectivity patterns of brains at rest. Whilst the majority of previous approaches to this problem have employed support vector machines (SVMs) we investigate the performance of Bayesian Gaussian process logistic regression (GP-LR) models with linear and non-linear covariance functions. GP-LR models can be interpreted as a Bayesian probabilistic analogue to kernel SVM classifiers. However, GP-LR methods confer a number of benefits over kernel SVMs. Whilst SVMs only return a binary class label prediction, GP-LR, being a probabilistic model, provides a principled estimate of the probability of class membership. Class probability estimates are a measure of the confidence the model has in its predictions, such a confidence score may be extremely useful in the clinical setting. Additionally, if miss-classification costs are not symmetric, thresholds can be set to achieve either strong specificity or sensitivity scores. Since GP-LR models are Bayesian, computationally expensive cross-validation hyper-parameter grid-search methods can be avoided. We apply these methods to a sample of 77 subjects; 27 with a diagnosis of probable AD, 50 with a diagnosis of a-MCI and a control sample of 39. All subjects underwent a MRI examination at 3. T to obtain a 7. minute and 20. second resting state scan. Our results support the hypothesis that GP-LR models can be effective at performing patient stratification: the implemented model achieves 75{\%} accuracy disambiguating healthy subjects from subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment and 97{\%} accuracy disambiguating amnesic mild cognitive impairment subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, accuracies are estimated using a held-out test set. Both results are significant at the 1{\%} level.},

Using graph theory, different aspects of the brain network can be efficiently characterized by calculating measures of integration and segregation. In this study, we combined a graph theoretical approach with advanced machine learning methods to study the brain network in 89 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 45 age-matched HC. The rs-fMRI connectivity matrix was constructed using a brain parcellation based on a 264 putative functional areas. Using the optimal features extracted from the graph measures, we were able to accurately classify three groups (i.e., HC, MCI, and AD) with accuracy of 88.4 {\%}. We also investigated performance of our proposed method for a binary classification of a group (e.g., MCI) from two other groups (e.g., HC and AD). The classification accuracies for identifying HC from AD and MCI, AD from HC and MCI, and MCI from HC and AD, were 87.3, 97.5, and 72.0 {\%}, respectively. In addition, results based on the parcellation of 264 regions were compared to that of the automated anatomical labeling atlas (AAL), consisted of 90 regions. The accuracy of classification of three groups using AAL was degraded to 83.2 {\%}. Our results show that combining the graph measures with the machine learning approach, on the basis of the rs-fMRI connectivity analysis, may assist in diagnosis of AD and MCI.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the changes in functional brain networks of AD patients using complex network theory. In this study, resting-state fMRI datasets of 10 AD patients and 11 healthy controls were collected. Time series of 90 brain regions were extracted from the fMRI datasets after preprocessing. Pearson correlation method was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between any two time series. Then, a wide threshold range was selected to transform the adjacency matrix to a binary matrix under a different threshold. The topology parameters of each binary network were calculated, and all of them were then averaged within a group. During the evolution, node betweenness and the Euclidean distance between the nodes were set as control factors. Each binary network of healthy controls underwent evolution of 100 steps in accordance with the evolution rules. Then, the topology parameters of the evolution network were calculated. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify the network topology parameters of the evolution network and to determine whether evolution results matched the datasets from AD patients. We found there were differing degrees of decline in global efficiency, clustering coefficient, number of edges and transitivity in AD patients compared with healthy controls. The topology parameters of the evolution network tended toward those of the AD group. The results of SVM classification of the evolution network show that the evolution network had a greater probability to be classified as an AD patients group. A new biological marker for diagnosis of AD was provided through comparison of topology parameters between AD patients and healthy controls. The study of network evolution strategies enriched the method of brain network evolution. The use of SVM to classify the results of network evolution provides an objective criteria for determining evolution results.},

Significant only at group level however these findings have had limited clinical translation, and recent attention has turned toward alternative forms of analysis, including Support-Vector-Machine (SVM). A type of machine learning, SVM allows categorisation of an individual's previously unseen data into a predefined group using a classification algorithm, developed on a training data set. In recent years, SVM has been successfully applied in the context of disease diagnosis, transition prediction and treatment prognosis, using both structural and functional neuroimaging data. Here we provide a brief overview of the method and review those studies that applied it to the investigation of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, presymptomatic Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and autistic spectrum disorder. We conclude by discussing the main theoretical and practical challenges associated with the implementation of this method into the clinic and possible future directions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The CAD tool is designed for the study and classification of functional brain images. For this purpose, two different brain image databases are selected: a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) database and positron emission tomography (PET) images, both of them containing data for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls as a reference. These databases are analyzed by applying the Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for feature selection and extraction of the most relevant features. The resulting NMF-transformed sets of data, which contain a reduced number of features, are classified by means of a SVM-based classifier with bounds of confidence for decision. The proposed NMF-SVM method yields up to 91{\%} classification accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity rates (upper than 90{\%}).

produce clusters that are similar for different leave-one-subject-

we chose to use a single region per experimental condition and

In this paper, we used convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer's brain from normal healthy brain. The importance of classifying this kind of medical data is to potentially develop a predict model or system in order to recognize the type disease from normal subjects or to estimate the stage of the disease. Classification of clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease has been always challenging and most problematic part has been always selecting the most discriminative features. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on trained data reached 96.85{\%}. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is most powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.

abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in memory circuit function in humans suffering from memory disorders. Since the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, a number of studies, reviewed here, have focused on this region of the brain. By the time individuals are diagnosed clinically with AD dementia, the substantial memory impairments appear to be associated with not only MTL atrophy but also hypoactivation during memory task performance. Prior to dementia, when individuals are beginning to manifest signs and symptoms of memory impairment, the hippocampal formation and other components of the MTL memory system exhibit substantial functional abnormalities during memory task performance. It appears that, early in the course of MCI when memory deficits and hippocampal atrophy are less prominent, there may be hyperactivation of MTL circuits, possibly representing inefficient compensatory activity. Later in the course of MCI, when considerable memory deficits are present, MTL regions are no longer able to activate during attempted learning, as is the case in AD dementia. Recent fMRI data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. As this work continues to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the incorporation of measures of task-related brain function into diagnostic assessment or therapeutic monitoring, such as for use in clinical trials. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A fast filter was applied afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and non-demented groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14{\%} average accuracy. Results repeatedly pointed out Brodmann regions with distinct activation patterns between demented and non demented profiles, indicating that the machine learning analysis described is a powerful method to detect differences in several brain regions between both groups.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

@misc{Pereira2009,
abstract = {Interpreting brain image experiments requires analysis of complex, multivariate data. In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of 'is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely 'where is the information' (pattern localization) and 'how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).},

@article{Wen2012,
	abstract = {Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Liong2013,
abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR) are often used for the purpose of classifying populations or groups using a set of predictor variables. Assumptions of multivariate normality and equal variance-covariance matrices across groups are required before proceeding with LDA, but such assumptions are not required for LR and hence LR is considered to be much more robust than LDA. In this paper, several real datasets which are different in terms of normality, number of independent variables and sample size are used to study the performance of both methods. The methods are compared based on the percentage of correct classification and B index. The results show that overall, LR performs better regardless of the distribution of the data is normal or nonnormal. However, LR needs longer computing time than LDA with the increase in sample size. The performance of LDA was also tested by using various prior probabilities. The results show that the average percentage of correct classification and the B index are higher when the prior probability is set based on the group size rather than using equal probabilities for all groups.
